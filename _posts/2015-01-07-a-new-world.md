title: A New World
---

New year, new regime, new work &amp; new world.

2015 is the year that I design and build a game. Something I've been threatening
to do for the past 15 years.

1. I have a premise (a 2D open world rogue like space exploration game based on
   survival and crafting)
2. I have the skills (I finally feel like I have the coding knowledge to tackle
   the coding needed for a small indie game)
3. I have the time (due to going freelance and working from home)

This is my attempt at logging the development process over the coming months. I
suspect sometimes these updates will be short and sweet and other times more in
depth when I feel like I can share something of use to the world.

Anyways: I'm posting this now... otherwise I'll never end up putting this out.

So it's been a week since I properly started building Nebulae... and here's a
quick breakdown of what's happened in the past week.

## SpriteKit + Swift

I originally started trying to build a game in Swift + SpriteKit for iOS, but it
quickly became obvious that for me (a beginner in both) that I was going to come
up against too many problems before I could build a decent enough prototype.

The documentation was a little fuzzy in places and I became annoyed that there
wasn't enough of a community around the SDK yet. So it made quick googling for
problems a little too hard.

Anyways, here's a quick screengrab of one of the first prototypes, that I got
working on iOS:

_You'll notice the `showPhysics = true` :)_

One thing I will say about `Swift` is that I really like the syntax. I wish
there were more type casted programming languages that felt as nice to work
with.

## Unity

So, once I gave up on SpriteKit I decided that I would move into making the game
in Unity. Since it's definitely a mature platform now :). So far I'm really
liking it. I do quite like the asset store as well, it made putting in
controller support for my prototype easier.

## Next steps

I'm rapidly getting towards a point where I'll have a semi-working prototype for
testing whether the game's main idea is actually going to be fun. I might even
play with posting binaries here to share the work in progress.
